# Same as in other OOP languages such as C++, lambda functions are just small anonymous functions. The syntax is as follows:
# lambda arguments : expression
x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))

# Same as common functions, lambda functions accept multiple input arguments:
y = lambda a, b : a + b
print(y(4, 7))
