# First, check if PIP is installed in your machine. Just type pip --version.
# If it's already installed, the version
# will be displayed.
# If that's not the case, go ahead and install it by using the "sudo apt install python-pip" command.
# Upgrading it may be required as well. To do so, use the "sudo pip install --upgrade pip" command.
# If any version of Python3 is already installed, it's strongly recommended to use sudo apt install python3-pip
# instead of any of the commands mentioned above.

# Once the Linux PIP package is installed and upgraded, it can be used to download python open-source modules
# from a large library. To find them, clock on the following link:
# https://pypi.org/

# In this case, a simple string encryption decryption library is going to be installed: https://pypi.org/project/scryp/.
# Type "pip3 install scryp" in the linux console to install it.
